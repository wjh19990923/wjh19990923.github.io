Hello, I am currently a PhD student in the Laboratory of Movement Biomechanics at the Institute for Biomechanics, ETH Zurich. In 2022, I graduated from the University of Oxford with a First-Class Master's degree in Engineering. I am now a member of Dr. B. Taylor's research group at ETH Zurich, where my research interests focus on medical image analysis, deep learning, and optimization. Beyond research, I am deeply passionate about teaching and mentoring the next generation of engineers.

Outside of academia, I enjoy engaging in various sports, particularly badminton, tennis, and skiing. This page highlights my academic journey, ongoing projects, and personal interests. However, these are just one aspect of my diverse life. If you are interested in collaboration or exploring my work further, feel free to reach out!

Research in Movement Biomechanics
======
My research group focuses on understanding the kinematics and kinetics of healthy, reconstructed, and replaced joints. We aim to develop cutting-edge medical technologies that enhance joint health and mobility. One of the core projects I am involved in is dual-plane fluoroscopy for tracking joint motion in 3D. Our lab also conducts extensive research on spine scoliosis detection and musculoskeletal modeling.

Dual-plane fluoroscopy, spine scoliosis detection, muscle-skeleton modelling... our lab lead various exploration into the field of biomechanics. For more information about our research, please visit the [official website of LMB](https://movement.ethz.ch/).

Education in Oxford
======
I spent four transformative years (2018-2022) at Lincoln College, University of Oxford, pursuing my undergraduate studies in Engineering Science. This rigorous program equipped me with a solid foundation in applied mathematics, mechanical engineering, electrical and electronic systems, and civil engineering.

As I progressed through my degree, I gradually shifted my focus towards Biomedical Engineering, which better aligned with my passion for integrating technology and healthcare. During my time at Oxford, I actively participated in the EUROP research program, investigating time-warping techniques for analyzing kinematics data. My academic journey culminated in earning a Distinction for my Master's thesis, a milestone that marked the beginning of my research career.

Leisure
------
Sport is the best investment to your brain. Years of playing racket sport could even enhance your lifespan - but that is not the main reason why I never stop playing sports - I simply love them. Whether it’s executing the perfect smash on the court or carving down a snowy mountain peak on skis, these activities remind me that beyond being a student, teacher, or researcher—I am an adventurer.
